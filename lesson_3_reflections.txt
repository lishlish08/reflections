1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

A remote would be helpful when you have other people that will work on the same
project. Also when you want to be able to access your project from multiple
machines (this is just one of the many ways that you could do it, just like you
could remote login to your pc, or use a cloud service to host it [which is
kind of the same thing here], etc).
